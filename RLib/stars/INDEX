                        objects
as                      Coerce stars object into a Raster raster or
                        brick
c.stars                 combine multiple stars objects, or combine
                        multiple attributes in a single stars object
                        into a single array
cut_stars               cut methods for stars objects
dplyr                   dplyr verbs for stars objects
plot.stars              plot stars object, with subplots for each level
                        of first non-spatial dimension
read_ncdf               read ncdf file into stars object
read_stars              read raster/array dataset from file or
                        connection
st_apply                st_apply apply a function to one or more array
                        dimensions
st_as_sf                Convert stars object into an sf object
st_as_stars             convert objects into a stars object
st_crop                 crop a stars object
st_dimensions           get dimensions from stars object
st_rasterize            rasterize simple feature geometries
st_transform            transform features, or warp/resample grids in
                        stars objects to a new coordinate reference
                        system
st_warp                 Warp (resample) grids in stars objects to a new
                        grid, possibly in an new coordinate reference
                        system
st_write.stars          write stars object to gdal dataset (typically:
                        to file)
st_xy2sfc               replace x y raster dimensions with simple
                        feature geometry list (points, or polygons =
                        rasterize)
