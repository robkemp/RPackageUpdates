README file for language support in koRpus
==========================================

As of koRpus 0.06-2, you can add new supported languages to the package on-the-fly from a running session, or (more elegant) by adding the appropriate function calls to a package of its own. It is still possible, but no longer necessary nor recommended, to add new language support to the koRpus package sources itself and rebuild the package.

There's two main sources to learn how to achieve this: the manual page ?set.lang.support and the commented template script you should find in the templates directory of your local koRpus installation.

For a really quick and comfortable method to turn that script into a proper R package, I recommend checking out http://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=roxyPackage
