# version 0.4-5

* add support for user-defined unit conversion; #31

* allow for 1/n integer powers, as in `set_units(1:10, m^-2) ^ 0.5`; #29

* properly set log units after log transform; #33

* `sin`, `cos` and `tan` no longer complain when units is `rad`, and return `unitless`; #40 

* now allow for `set_units(1:3, "Â°C")` and also `set_units(1:3, "degree_Celsius")` by resolving names to symbols first; #43

* `set_units(x)` with `x` numeric sets units to `unitless`; #41

# version 0.4-4

* fix a result units bug when multiplying or dividing units vectors of different length, #34

* add a `rep` method for `units` vectors

# version 0.4-3

* support for `set_units(1:10, m)` which does not require to declare or define, `m` (`m` is resolved automatically from `ud_units`)
