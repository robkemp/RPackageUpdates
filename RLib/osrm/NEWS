# osrm version 3.3.0 (Release date: 2019-04-29)

This version should not break previous code.
## Major changes
* sf support in all functions for input (src, dst, loc) and output (returnclass="sf")
* The algorithm for isochrone has been changed to a more robust one that use isoband package, results may differ...
* add apotheke.sf sf POINT in the package dataset "berlin". 
* examples have been simplified and mainly cover sf use. 



# osrm version 3.2.0 (Release date: 2018-12-12)

## Minor changes
* Add the exclude option to exclude some road types. Thanks to PR #32 by @mbask 
* Better info message when the public server receive too many requests. 
* Add a "measure" arg to osrmTable to obtain distance table (meters). fix #33.   
* Berlin example in README



# osrm version 3.1.1 (Release date: 2018-03-12)

## Minor changes
* Put sp in Import rather than in Depends
* bug fix in osrmTrip.
* Better error messages.


# osrm version 3.1.0 (Release date: 2017-06-08)

## Minor changes
* Use last version of cartography in examples
* Adaptation to the current osrm demo server (ex. gepaf arg in osrmTable). 
* Examples in Berlin instead of north of France, easier with OSRM example docker image



# osrm version 3.0.2 (Release date: 2017-06-08)

## Minor changes
* set the grid size for computing isochrones in osrmIsochrone (more precise isopleth maps)
* fix osrmTrip






# osrm version 3.0.1 (Release date: 2017-03-31)

## Minor changes
* Enable changing the profile via options(osrm.profile = "name.of.the.profile")(driving is set by default).

# osrm version 3.0.0 (Release date: 2016-05-10)

This is a major release. Changes have been made to reflect the evolution of the OSRM routing service/engine.
The backward compatibility is not ensured. The osrm package works with the version 5.0.0 of the OSRM API.


## Major changes:
* osrmViaroute is suppressed, use osrmRoute with `overview = FALSE` instead.
* osrmViarouteGeom is replaced by osrmRoute. osrmRoute offers simplified or detailed (full) route geometry via `overview` parameter. 
* Functions now accept sp objects and data.frames.
* Add osrmIsochrone. This function computes a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of isochrones.
* Add osrmTrip. This function gets the travel geometry between multiple unordered points.
* Under the hood: some function now use google encoded polylines via gepaf package. 



# osrm version 2.0.0 (Release date: 2016-01-20)


This is a major release. Changes have been made to reflect the evolution of the OSRM routing service/engine.
