geojsonio 0.6.0
===============

## NEW FEATURES

* `topojson_write()` gains a new parameter `object_name`. With it you can set the name for the resulting TopoJSON object name created. As part of this `geo2topo()` also gains a new parameter, similarly called `object_name`, that does the same thing as for `topojson_write()`. (#129) (thanks @josiekre) PR (#131)
* As part of PR (#132) we added a new function `geojson_sf()` to convert output of `geojson_list()` or `geojson_json()` to `sf` package classes - as an analog to `geojson_sp()`

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `geojson_json()` gains option with the `type` parameter to skip a coercion to the `geojson` package class `geoclass`. Using `type = "skip"` you can skip the `geoclass` class coercion, which in some cases with large datasets should have performance improvements (#128) PR (#133)

### BUG FIXES

* A bug arose in `geojson_sp()` with the newest version of `rgdal`. This was resolved by using the `sf` package instead to read GeoJSON. This had a knock-on benefit of speeding up reading GeoJSON. In addition, `sf` is now in `Imports` instead of `Suggests`  (#130) PR (#132)


geojsonio 0.5.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* gains new function `geojson_atomize` to "atomize" a FeatureCollection
into its features, or a GeometryCollection into its geometries (#120)
via (#119) thx @SymbolixAU
* gains new functions `topojson_list` and `topojson_json` for converting
many input types with spatial data to TopoJSON, both as lists and
as JSON (#117)
* `geojson_json` uses brief output provided by the `geojson`
package - this makes it less frustrating when you have an especially
large geojson string that prints to console - this instead prints a
brief summary of the GeoJSON object (#86) (#124)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* doing a much more thorough job of cleaning up temp files that are
necessarily generated due to having to go to disk sometimes (#122)
* @ateucher made improvements to `geojson_json` to make `type`
parameter more flexible (#125)

### BUG FIXES

* Fixe bug in `topojson_write` - we were writing topojson file, but also
a geojson file - we now cleanup the geojson file (#127)


geojsonio 0.4.2
===============

### BUG FIXES

* Fix package so that we load `topojson-server.js` from within the
package instead of from the web. This makes it so that the
package doesnâ€™t make any web requests on load, which prevented package
from loading when no internet connection available. (#118)


geojsonio 0.4.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* Gains new functions `geo2topo`, `topo2geo`, `topojson_write`, and `topojson_read` for working with TopoJSON data - associated with this, we
now import `geojson` package (#24) (#100)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated vignette with details on the GeoJSON specification to the new
specification at <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946> (#114)



geojsonio 0.3.8
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `geojson_write` and `geojson_json` now pass `...` argument through to
`rgdal::writeOGR` or `jsonlite::toJSON` depending on the class/method. For
those methods that use the latter, this now allows setting of the `na`
argument to control how `NA` values are represented in json, and the
`pretty` argument to control whether or the resulting json is
pretty-formated or compact (#109) (#111)
* Spelling/grammar fixes, thanks @patperu ! (#106)

### BUG FIXES

* `geojson_json` and `geojson_write` now convert unsupported classes to
their basic class before conversion and/or writing to geojson. This was most
commonly occurring with fields in `sf` objects calculated by `sf::st_area`
and `sf::st_length` which were of class `units`. (#107)
* Fixed a bug occurring with `GDAL` version >= 2.2.0 where the layer name in
a geojson file was not detected properly (#108)


geojsonio 0.3.2
==============

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to tests for internal fxn `convert_wgs84` to do minimal test of
output, and to conditionally test only if `sf` is available (#103)


geojsonio 0.3.0
==============

### NEW FEATURES

* `geojson_json`, `geojson_list`, and `geojson_write` gain new S3 methods:
`sf`, `sfc`, and `sfg` - the three classes in the `sf` package (#95)
* `geojson_json`, `geojson_list`, and `geojson_write` gain two new
parameters each: `convert_wgs84` (boolean) to convert to WGS84 or not (the
projection assumed for GeoJSON)  and `crs` to assign a CRS if known
(#101) (#102)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `geojson_json()` for non-sp classes now only keeps seven decimal places
in the coordinates. This follows the default that GDAL uses.
* Now namespacing base package calls for `methods`/`stats`/`utils`
instead of importing them
* Improved documentation for `method` parameter in `geojson_read`
clarifying what the options are for (#93) thanks @bhaskarvk
* Internal fxn `to_json` now defaults to 7 digits, which is used in
`as.json` and `geojson_json` (#96)

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to `geojson_read` to read correctly from a URL - in addition
to file paths (#91) (#92) thanks @lecy
* Fix to `geojson_read` to read non-`.geojson` extensions (#93)
thanks @bhaskarvk


geojsonio 0.2.0
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Major performance improvement for `geojson_json()` - moved to
reading in json with `readr::read_file()` (#85) thanks @javrucebo !
* Now requiring explicit versions of some package dependencies
* Removed the startup message

### BUG FIXES

* Changed `file_to_geojson()` to use `httr::write_disk()` instead of
`download.file()` (#83) thanks @patperu

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

* The two linting functions in this package, `lint()` and `validate()`
are now deprecated, and will be defunct in the next version of this
package. See the new package `geojsonlint` on CRAN for linting
geojson functionality (#82)

geojsonio 0.1.8
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New method `geojson_sp.json()` added to `geojson_sp()` to handle json
class inputs

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added `encodin="UTF-8"` to `httr::content()` calls

### BUG FIXES

* `geojson_write()` didn't overwrite existing files despite saying so.
New parameter added to the function `overwrite` to specify whether to
overwrite a function or not, which defaults to `TRUE` (#81)
thanks @Robinlovelace !

geojsonio 0.1.6
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New function `geojson_sp()` to convert output of `geojson_list()` or
`geojson_json()` to spatial classes (e.g., `SpatialPointsDataFrame`) (#71)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Startup message added to notify users to ideally update to `rgdal > v1.1-1`
given fix to make writing multipolygon objects to geojson correct (#69)
* Filled out test suite more (#46)

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to `lint()` function, due to bug in passing data to the Javascript
layer (#73)
* Fixes to `as.json()` (#76)

geojsonio 0.1.4
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New function `map_leaf()` uses the `leaflet` package to make maps, with
S3 methods for most spatial classes as well as most R classes, including
data.frame's, lists, vectors, file inputs, and more (#48)
* `geojson_read()` now optionally can give back a spatial class object,
just a convenience in case you want to not get back geojson, but a
spatial class (#60)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Now that `leaflet` R package is on CRAN, put back in examples using
it to make maps (#49)
* Added a linter for list inputs comined with `geometry="polygon"` to
all `geojson_*()` functions that have `.list` methods. This checks to
make sure inputs have the same first and last coordinate pairs to
close the polygon (#34)

### BUG FIXES

* Importing all non-base R funtions, including from `methods`, `stats` and `utils`
packages (#62)
* Fixed bug in `geojson_write()` in which geojson style names were altered
on accident (#56)

geojsonio 0.1.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* released to CRAN
