ggridges 0.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Expanded documentation and gallery of example plots.
- Reworked stat_density_ridges, geom_ridgeline, geom_density_ridges,
  etc. so that jittered points and quantile lines can be drawn
  on top of the distributions. Points and quantile lines can be
  styled separately from the rest of the ridgeline plot, via
  special aesthetics.
- Added position options to control how the jittered points are drawn.
  Default is uniformly spaced within the density area.
- Added `geom_density_line()` which is a drop-in replacement for
  `geom_density()` but draws a ridgeline rather than a closed
  polygon.
- `theme_ridges()` has been modified so that font sizes match the cowplot
  themes. In particular, this means smaller axis tick labels.

ggridges 0.4.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Skip vdiffr visual tests when compiling on CRAN

ggridges 0.4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Initial import of code base from ggjoy, and renaming:
  geom_joy -> geom_density_ridges
  stat_joy -> stat_density_ridges
  theme_joy -> theme_ridges

ggjoy 0.3.0.9000
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Added an option to center axis labels to `theme_joy()`.

ggjoy 0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Added cyclical scales that make it easy to alternate between fill colors
  and other aesthetics.

ggjoy 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Numerous improvements:
- New stat `binline` that can be used to draw histogram joyplots.
- Various improvements in `stat_joy`. In particular, it now works properly
  with multiple panels. It also now has parameters `from` and `to` to limit the
  range of density estimation, just like `density()`.
- Improvements in the vignettes
- New geoms `geom_ridgeline_gradient` and `geom_joy_gradient` that can handle gradient fills.

ggjoy 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
First complete implementation ready for initial release
